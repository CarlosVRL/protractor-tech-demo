# Protractor Tech Demo
A simple case study showing off TDD using Protractor for an AngularJS + Spring Jhipster application.

# Quickstart

```
cd <project directory>
npm install
gulp protractor # uses mozilla firefox by default
```

This application was generated using JHipster 4.9.0, you can find documentation and help at [http://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v4.9.0](http://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v4.9.0).

## Development

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. [Node.js][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.
2. [Yarn][]: We use Yarn to manage Node dependencies.
   Depending on your system, you can install Yarn either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.
You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

    yarn install

We use [Gulp][] as our build system. Install the Gulp command-line tool globally with:

    yarn global add gulp-cli

Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

    ./mvnw
    gulp

[Bower][] is used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in [bower.json](bower.json). You can also run `bower update` and `bower install` to manage dependencies.
Add the `-h` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `bower update -h`.

For further instructions on how to develop with JHipster, have a look at [Using JHipster in development][].

## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

    ./mvnw clean test

### Client tests

Unit tests are run by [Karma][] and written with [Jasmine][]. They're located in [src/test/javascript/](src/test/javascript/) and can be run with:

    gulp test

### E2E tests

UI end-to-end tests are powered by [Protractor][], which is built on top of WebDriverJS. They're located in [src/test/javascript/e2e](src/test/javascript/e2e)
and can be run by starting Spring Boot in one terminal (`./mvnw spring-boot:run`) and running the tests (`gulp itest`) in a second one.
